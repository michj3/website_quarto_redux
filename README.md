Hello! Welcome to my website, where is it a work in progress. My website is a project that uses R-studio and Github. I am learning how to connect these two together through the push and commit commands, and this website is a reflection of that. 

It is a work in progress, as I am still learning. 

I am currently a third-year student at the University of Toronto, doing a double major in immunology and statistics. I am hoping to add my future work to this website, as a personal reference. 

I am excited to progress with this website.
